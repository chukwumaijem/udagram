# Project Two

Scenario
Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram.

Developers want to deploy a new application to the AWS infrastructure.

You have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application, along with the necessary supporting software.

This needs to be automated so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.

Optional - To add more challenge to the project, once the project is completed, you can try deploying sample website files located in a public S3 Bucket to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance. Though, it is not the part of the project rubric.

### Project Title - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

This folder provides the starter code for the "ND9991 - C2- Infrastructure as Code - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation" project. This folder contains the following files:

#### final-project-starter.yml

Students have to write the CloudFormation code using this YAML template for building the cloud infrastructure, as required for the project.

#### server-parameters.json

Students may use a JSON file for increasing the generic nature of the YAML code. For example, the JSON file contains a "ParameterKey" as "EnvironmentName" and "ParameterValue" as "UdacityProject".

In YAML code, the `${EnvironmentName}` would be substituted with `UdacityProject` accordingly.

### Future Notes

- Unless ssl certificate is install, remember to use http. AWS opens https by default.
